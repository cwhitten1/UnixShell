Environment Variables Explained
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is how I think env variables work:

- When shell process is started, the parent OS environment variables are copied into the process.
- When your shell calls getenv() or setenv(), it is modifying the process copy NOT the parent copy.
- Shells can maintain a local copy of the environment variables as well which will be instantiated in shell_init()
- These local copies must be updated whenver the process copies are also updated.  
- Updating the local copies without updating the process copy may cause problems for forked processes.
- I have no clue what a forked process is
